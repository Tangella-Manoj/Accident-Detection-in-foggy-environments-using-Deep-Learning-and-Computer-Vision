# Accident Detection in Foggy environments

I created a deep learning model using MobileNet to detect accidents in real-time, even in low-visibility conditions like fog. The system enhances images using computer vision techniques before classification.
Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, MobileNet.

Features:

Real-time accident detection.

Optimization for foggy environments with image enhancement techniques.
